# Speaker Classification Project

## Project Description
This repository contains a machine learning project developed as part of the Semester 7 Machine Learning module. The project includes a model that classifies the speaker, age, gender, and accent using audio data.

## Dataset
The AudioMNIST dataset is used to create the features for this project. This dataset provides a large amount of data suitable for our task.
The feature extraction model used in this project is Wav2vec base, which is commonly used for audio data. It consists of 12 transformer layers that effectively extract necessary features from the audio data.

## Programming Language
Python is used as the programming language for this project due to its extensive support for machine learning libraries and easy syntax.
